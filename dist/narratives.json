While Oil and Gas exploration off of the Atlantic coast will be on hold for the 2017-2022 Leasing Program,  offshore wind power is poised to deliver an essential contribution to a clean, robust, and diversified U.S. energy portfolio. Capturing and using this large and inexhaustible resource has the potential to mitigate climate change, improve the environment, increase energy security, and stimulate the U.S. economy. Loss of sand from the Nation’s beaches, dunes, and barrier islands is a serious problem that affects both the coastal environment and the economy. America’s Outer Continental Shelf is a valuable source for sand and gravel used to restore hundreds of miles of coastline, and protect billions of dollars in infrastructure and important ecological habitats.  <br>Sources: <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy10osti/49229.pdf\">National Renewable Energy Lab</a> and <a target='_blank' href='http://www.boem.gov/Marine-Minerals-Program/'>BOEM Marine Minerals Program</a>" },
