                        Sand Resources are areas with sediment potentially available for beach renourishment
                        projects.
                        Each resource is attributed with a level of confidence based on the results of
                        reconnaissance level studies.
                        The more available environmental data, the more confidence there is in the presence of
                        restoration quality sand.<br>
